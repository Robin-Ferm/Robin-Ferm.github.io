### Individual exercises: Create a blog on GitHub with Jekyll

Blog is up and running, although it is running on Jekyll I did not follow the instructions given by the teacher since I couldn't get it to work properly. I eventually found another solution which I found to be a lot easier. If this method is not allowed I'll have to make changes to the blog at a later date, but for now it will have to do.
