# What is the Cloud?


To be as short of an aswer that I can manage, the cloud is simply a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single ecosystem. These servers are designed to either store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are accessing them online from any Internet-capable deviceâ€”the information will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it (also, I stole this definition from [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-the-cloud/) themselves, but I found it to be a short and easy to understand answer).


# What are some Pros and Cons with Cloud?

### Let's start with the pros.

The company that decides to use the cloud for their business have an easy way of accessing all their data and applications via the internet without having to maintain physical infrastructure. This way many businesses can reduce cost and instead focus on their core business rather than IT problems.

Did I mention that it is scalable? Well, it is! So if you need more horse power for you program (or whatever you're developing), rent a few more units! Easy and simple.

Here is a neat little list of some pros of using cloud computing.

- You don't need to run your own infrastructure
- Scalable
- Accessible from anywhere
- Reliability

### And lastly, the cons.

From what I understand, some cloud storage providers offer a specific bandwidth allowance and if you somehow exceed that your company may incur additional charges.

Another con would be the price overall, you will always have to pay a monthly/annual fee if you want to keep it running. 

Another concern would be security and cyber attacks. Cloud providers are often targets of cyber attacks that want to steal information, since they often sit on an extremely big amount of data that can be used and abused.

Fourth and last con (that I can think of right now) is that you'd have to know where the data you're uploading is stored in the world thanks to GDPR.

# My conclusion about pricing from different Cloud Computing Providers

Prices for a Virtual Machine:

- Azure: OS Only = Average $145 per month
- AWS EC2: Estimated $67 per month
- Google: $7.759 per month

And just typing these out, my conclusion would be that I've made an error somewhere when looking up the prices or Googles option is just insane and not worth it at all. The error could be on my part since there are a lot of options (but I picked the  lowest number on everything) and different wording depending on company you're on. Also, Google seem to have fewer locations to choose from so I had to pick London, meanwhile AWS had a server in Stockholm, so looking at the price and location differences I'd pick AWS in a heartbeat, but I'd obviously have to do more research if I someday in the future needed to buy a cloud servce like this. Maybe Google offers something that AWS doesn't which I needed. 

Azure seem to land somewhere in the middle between Google and AWS and since I'm a .NET developer myself I'd might have to pick and choose them even if the price is higher just because I'd be more familiar with their products and tools.
