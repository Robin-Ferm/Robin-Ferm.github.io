## What's the difference between horizontal and vertical application scaling?  

Scaling up (vertical) simply means that you replace your old maching with a bigger more powerful machine.

Scaling out (horizontal) means you add more processing units and/or physical machines to your server or database. It involves growing the number of nodes in the cluster, reducing the responsibilities of each member node by spreading the the work wider for client connections.

## Scaling cost differences

Generally, horizontal scaling (scaling out) is more expensive because you need to add more servers/machines to your pool of resources. You can have servers up in more than one region so you'll ensure you have a High Availability.

Meanwhile vertical scaling is only one machine, and they're getting better (more cores) and cheaper by the day. So, vertical scaling

## Not all Azure Service App plans can be scaled up/out, why?

I believe that's because there are different Service Tiers, for example the free tier does not allow for scaling. The tiers that allow scaling in different ways are Basic, Standard, Premium and Isolated.
