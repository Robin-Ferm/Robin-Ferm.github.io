## What does the application do?

well, it's quite simple actually. It's a To do list website! You input things into a list that you're planning on doing, and you can edit the things already in the database or you can delete them.
I gave up  on my movielist project, which was my database from the previous lecture. I couldn't get it to work properly, only managed to display the things I've already put in the databse, so I instead tried to look for a tutorial on how to do this properly, which led me to the To-do list! I followed [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-dotnet-application) mostly.

## What does to code do?

A lot of the code is from the template when creating an ASP.NET Core Web App but I'll try to explain how it works.
