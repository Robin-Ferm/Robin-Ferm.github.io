## What Is Serverless And Function As A Service?


The short and simple answer would be that **Serverless** is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build an run applications without having to manage servers themselves. The name serverless might make you believe there are no servers at all but thats not true, there are still servers but they are managed by the cloud provider so you don't have to think about it at all, you can instead focus on your application.

**Function as a Service** (FaaS) means you write and deploy standalone functions on the cloud, instead of entire apps. Each function serves a distinct need and handles a distinct event, like a web request.

The functions you write are only loaded in memory when there is a request or event for them to handle and unloaded after serving that request. They also share the same hardware and possibly the same runtime with everybody elseâ€™s functions. As a result, you generally only pay for the CPU time consumed by your functions, and not for the entire server or VM.
